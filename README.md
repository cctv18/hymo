> **Hymo** is a high-performance hybrid mount meta-module designed for KernelSU. It refactors core logic with native C++ and introduces HymoFS, which hijacks the kernel file system to use VFS mapping directly instead of mounting, achieving a realistic mounting effect.

## Core Architecture

Hymo is not just a mount script; it is a complete native daemon designed to solve performance bottlenecks and compatibility issues of traditional shell scripts in complex mounting scenarios.

### 1. Native C++ Engine
*   **High Performance**: Core logic is written entirely in C++, discarding inefficient Shell script calls.
*   **Direct System Calls**: Uses modern Linux Mount APIs like `fsopen`, `fsconfig`, `fsmount`, `move_mount` directly, bypassing `mount` command-line limitations for finer mount control.
*   **Blazing Fast Startup**: Optimized execution flow ensures module loading adds almost no overhead to system boot time.

### 2. HymoFS & Multi-Mode Engine
Hymo introduces proprietary **HymoFS** technology, building a three-tier mount strategy:
*   **HymoFS (Kernel Mode)**: Opens a kernel interface after patching the kernel source, directly hijacking the underlying file system to implement file mapping instead of mounting, allowing for hot recovery.
*   **OverlayFS (General Mode)**: The preferred solution in standard environments, utilizing kernel OverlayFS features for file-level merging.
*   **Magic Mount (Compatibility Mode)**: A traditional Bind Mount fallback for old kernels or special partitions.
*   **Dynamic Decision**: The daemon automatically detects the environment to select the best mode, or users can force a specific mode via WebUI.

### 3. Smart Sync
*   **Incremental Update**: Automatically compares module `module.prop` and file timestamps at startup.
*   **Zero Redundant I/O**: Only synchronizes changed module files to the working directory, significantly reducing I/O pressure during startup and extending flash memory life.

### 4. Smart Storage Backend
*   **Smart Space Management**: Automatically detects kernel Tmpfs support during installation. If supported, it skips creating Ext4 images and uses the in-memory file system directly, saving user storage space.
*   **Tmpfs Priority**: Prioritizes building module images in memory at runtime, offering the fastest speed and "burn after reboot" (high stealth).
*   **Ext4 Image Fallback**: Automatically falls back to `modules.img` loopback image only when the kernel does not support Tmpfs, ensuring functional availability.

## Build & Install

Hymo uses a standard Makefile build system and supports cross-compilation.

**Prerequisites**:
*   Android NDK (r25+)
*   Node.js & npm (for building WebUI)
*   Make & Zip

**HymoFS Patch**
If you need to use HymoFS, please add the following to your compilation script when compiling the kernel:
```bash
patch -p1 -F 3 < https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anatdx/hymo/refs/heads/master/patch/hymofs.patch
echo "CONFIG_HYMOFS=y" >> ./common/arch/arm64/configs/gki_defconfig # Write to defconfig
```

**Build Commands**:
```bash
# Compile all architectures and package
make zip

# Compile arm64 only and generate test package
make testzip
```

**Install**:
The generated zip package can be flashed directly in KernelSU Manager.
